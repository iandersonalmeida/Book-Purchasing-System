## General info
The project is an application that addresses the idea of microservices, which describes components of a system that are independent or "loosely coupled". Each component has a defined responsibility and the resources it needs to function. For the development of the application's microservices, Spring Boot, MySQL for database management, the Postman tool for building HTTP requests and React for the user interface are currently being used.
