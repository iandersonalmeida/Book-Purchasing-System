## General info
The project is an application that addresses the idea of microservices, which describes components of a system that are independent or "loosely coupled". Each component has a defined responsibility and the resources it needs to function. For the development of the application's microservices, Spring Boot, MySQL for database management, the Postman tool for building HTTP requests and React/Next for the user interface are currently being used.

## Development

### Returning data from the book service
![backendside-data-return](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a97b13bb-0830-4c29-8cfa-672763f14d36)

Here is an example of communication between a MySQL database and a Spring Boot application that represents a service in the microservices architecture, in this case, a book service. I am using Spring Data JPA to access the database as well as the MVC architecture concept. Since this is a REST-based application, the service returns data in JSON format.

### Homepage developed with Next.js
![](homepage.PNG)  

This homepage was developed using the Next.js framework. Next.js is defined as a React framework. Thus, from the React point of view, a component was created, rendered and displayed on the screen.

This component represents the application's homepage and is a Javascript function that contains other components. Tailwind CSS was also used to add style to the page.
