## General info
The project is an application that addresses the idea of microservices, which describes components of a system that are independent or "loosely coupled". Each component has a defined responsibility and the resources it needs to function.  For the development of the application's microservices, Spring framwork, MySQL for database management and the Postman tool for building HTTP requests are currently being used.

## Development
Through the Spring Starter Project I configured this project with what is necessary for the development of this microservice-based application.

## Project Status
The project is currently under development.

## Inspiration
This application is based on the book: Spring Microservices in Action.
